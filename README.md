# Bread Calculator

I built this project to help calculate the amount of water, salt, and starter required to make a loaf using a predetermined amount of flour and an adjustable ratio of water.

I later added the starter calculator which determines how much flour, water, and starter is required to reach a desired amount of total starter.

While on the train from Paris to London I built out the third component, the Starter Multiplier. The Starter Multiplier assists the baker with calculating the amount of water and flour to add given an initial amount of starter in grams. The user may select a 1:3:3 or 1:5:5 ratio.
